[0.0.8]
- Input change for all functions from directory and file names to paths
- Convert_Method functions now return the path of the converted file to allow for chaining operations by nesting functions, e.g., 
change duration and then convert: to_CVTank(change_duration(path,duration),Hmin,Hdes)
-Run_Method functions's return now unpacks into time series, mean, low percentile and high percentile. Results from these files can now be
displayed, plotted or processed within the same script
- bug fixes

[0.0.9]
- Bug fixes

[1.0.0]
First Major Release!
- Convert_Method converts vanilla EPANET files into any of the IWS methods in the literature based on minimum and desired pressure inputs.
 Also converts from one assumed supply duration to another.
- Run_Method executes and processes IWS EPANET or EPA-SWMM input files created by Convert_Method functions. Options for processing the output based on demand satisfaction or pressures.
Options for plotting, timing the execution and saving outputs in csv format

[1.0.1]
- Optimizations and bug fixes in writing SWMM files

[1.0.2]
- Outlet-Storage now uses simple control rules to stop flow into the tank

[1.1.0]
- Added the Float-Storage Method based on a mixture of literature recommendations (foremeost Campisano et al. (2019) Modelling Private Tanks in EPA-SWMM)
- Streamlined Convert_Method by further modularization: __discretize_pipe__ and __match_concentric__ functions
- Updated path system to use pathlib for seamless path handling across platforms (e.g., POSIX and Windows)
